# 🚀 Launching My New Project: A Fullstack E-Commerce Platform 🎉
I’m excited to share my latest project, a Fullstack E-Commerce Application that includes all the essential features needed for a modern online store! 🌟

🔹 Key Features:

✅ 1- Secure Authentication System
The platform provides a secure and seamless login experience using Clerk, supporting email/password authentication as well as social logins like Google.

✅ 2- Integrated Payment System
Payments are processed securely via Stripe, allowing credit card transactions and other payment options, with full support for managing payments and invoices.

✅ 3- Flexible REST API
A fully functional REST API enables seamless access to products, orders, users, and payments, making integrations smooth and efficient.

✅ 4- Email Notifications
Automated email notifications are sent using Sendemail for key actions like order confirmations, shipping updates, and user registrations.

✅ 5- Product & Content Management System (Backend & CMS)
All products, orders, and users are managed through Strapi, a powerful headless CMS that provides an intuitive admin panel for easy data management.

✅ 6- Modern & Fast Frontend UI/UX
The frontend is built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive design, smooth user experience, and high performance.
